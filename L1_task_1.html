  <h1>What is HTML and CSS</h1>
  <hr>
  <p><b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b> - is used for creating web applications and websites. Below, we break the expansion down for better understanding:
    HyperText: HyperText or “text wrapped within a text.” is very similar to a hyperlink, but contains an underlying text which, when clicked, initiates a redirection to a new webpage.
    Markup language: A markup language need be a programming language, but helps in applying formatting and layout to a text document. It helps create a more dynamic and interactive text content.</p>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes.HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:
      Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files.Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
      Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
      It’s also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. It is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates. 
      This article will go over the basics of HTML, including how it works, its pros and cons, and how it relates to CSS and JavaScript. </p>
  <p><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> - fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as font, layout, and colors.
        The style definitions are usually saved in external .css files.</p>
      <p>The difference between a web page that implements CSS and one that doesn’t is massive and surely noticeable.
        You might have seen a website that fails to load completely and has a white background color with most of the text being blue and black. This means that the CSS part of the web page didn’t load correctly or it doesn’t exist altogether.
        That’s what web pages with only HTML look like, and I think you’d agree that that’s not very appealing.
        Before using CSS, all of the stylizing had to be included into the HTML markup. This means web developers had to separately describe the background color, font size, alignments, etc.
        CSS lets you stylize everything on a different file, thus creating the design there and later on integrating the CSS files on top of the HTML markup. This makes the actual HTML markup much cleaner and easier to maintain.
        In short, with CSS features you don’t need to repeatedly describe how individual elements look. This saves time, shortens the code, and makes it not as prone to errors.
        CSS lets you have multiple styles on one HTML page, therefore making the customization possibilities almost endless. Nowadays, this is becoming more a necessity than a commodity.</p>
