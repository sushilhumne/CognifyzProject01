                                <p>kingfisher, any of about 90 species of birds in three families (Alcedinidae, Halcyonidae, and Cerylidae), 
                noted for their spectacular dives into water. They are worldwide in distribution but are chiefly tropical. 
                Kingfishers, ranging in length from 10 to 42 cm (4 to 16.5 inches), have a large head, a long and massive bill, and a compact body. 
                heir feet are small, and, with a few exceptions,the tail is short or medium-length. Most species have vivid plumage in bold patterns, and many are crested

                                <p class="subtitle">The Motmot</p>
                                <p>motmot, any of about 10 species of long-tailed forest birds of the family Momotidae (order Coraciiformes) of Central and South America. 
                                    In six species the two central tail feathers are elongated and become racket-tipped as very brittle barbs (branches) along the shaft snap off in preening. 
                                    Motmots are about 17 to 50 cm (6.5 to 20 inches) long and are mostly brownish green, often with touches of bright blue on the head or wings.
                                    Motmots take flying insects and pluck a variety of other invertebrates and small vertebrates from branches.

                                <p>kookaburra, also called laughing kookaburra or laughing jackass, (species Dacelo novaeguineae), 
                eastern Australian bird of the kingfisher family (Alcedinidae), whose call sounds like fiendish laughter. 
                This gray-brown, woodland-dwelling bird reaches a length of 43 cm (17 inches), 
                with an 8- to 10-cm (3.2- to 4-inch) beak. In its native habitat it eats invertebrates and small vertebrates, 
                including venomous snakes.
